### 5. Creating Organizational Units (OUs)

  In this stage I began organizing my domain by creating OUs. This structure makes administration easier and keeps users, groups, and computers separated in a clean         hierarchy.

### 5.1 Opening Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)

  1. I clicked Start → Server Manager → Tools → Active Directory Users and Computers.
  2. ADUC opened and displayed my domain lab.local.

### 5.2 Creating New OUs

  1. In the left pane, I right-clicked my domain name lab.local.
  2. I selected New → Organizational Unit.

  3. I created the following OUs:
    * Users
    * Groups
    * Computers
    * IT
    * HR
  4. I unchecked Protect container from accidental deletion where needed.
